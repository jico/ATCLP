# Air Traffic Control Language Processor
## Stockton College Software Project

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Human Factors Team-Atlantic City (HFTAC) employs scientific methods and advanced technology in the conduct of research and development to ensure that systems that include human operators and maintainers perform as effectively and safely as possible.  Within the Research, Development, and Human Factors Laboratory (RDHFL), HFTAC conducts research to develop methods of measuring human performance in the aviation environments, to evaluate longer term operational concepts, and to develop useful databases and design standards through the use of high fidelity rapid prototyping and human-in-the-loop Air Traffic Control (ATC) simulation capabilities.

Realistic traffic flows and voice communications are used in the ATC simulations.  Air Traffic Controllers act as the simulation participants while pilots operate the simulated aircraft in response to ATC instructions.  The goal of this project is to create a software engine capable of interpreting transcribed ATC voice instructions, determining the type and parameters of the instruction, as well as the intended recipient.  For example, the instruction “United thirteen zero seven, climb and maintain flight level three three zero” represents an altitude clearance to FL330 (33,000 feet) for the aircraft having the call sign of UAL1307 (United Airlines flight 1307).
